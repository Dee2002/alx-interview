# Lockboxes

## Description

- This directory contains a Python project aimed at solving the "Lockboxes" problem. The problem involves determining whether all the boxes in a collection of locked boxes can be opened, where each box may contain keys to other boxes, and a key with the same number as a box can open that box.

## Function Prototype

```
python
def canUnlockAll(boxes)

-    boxes: A list of lists representing the locked boxes.
-    Returns True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise False.

```

## Requirements

-    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
-    All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
-    Files should end with a new line
-    The first line of all files should be #!/usr/bin/python3
-    A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
-    Code should be documented
-    Code should use PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
-    All files must be executable

## File Structure

-    0-lockboxes.py: Python script containing the implementation of the canUnlockAll method.
-    main_0.py: Python script to test the canUnlockAll method with example cases.

## Running the Code

```
./main_0.py
```
