# Prime Game

## Description

Maria and Ben are playing a game with prime numbers. Given a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`, they take turns choosing a prime number from the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player that cannot make a move loses the game. 

They play `x` rounds of the game, where `n` may be different for each round. Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, this project determines who the winner of each game is.
